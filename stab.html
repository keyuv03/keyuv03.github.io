        <p><strong>Background:</strong> 
            <br></br>
            For my aircraft stability and controls class, we had a semester long project involving us performing a full stability (longitudinal, directional, and lateral) analysis of the Beechcraft Model 18. 
            This project not only consisted of performing various hand calculations to derive various stability coefficients, but also researching and finding all of the required information needed for stability analysis.
            <br></br>

            In this project, I led a group of four people (myself included).
            We worked as a team completing our own calculations independently, aiding one another as needed. 
            At the end we compiled our results and wrote a report that detailed the methodology employed, as well as the results. 
            The goal was for everyone to have relatively similar results, within a small margin of error. 
            We were to write and compare and justify our results, if they seemed fit.

            <strong>Objectives:</strong>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Research and obtain all of the necessary information to analyze the Beechcraft Model 18â€™s stability</li>
                <li>Perform all of the necessary stability calculations to obtain the results</li>
                <li>Obtain the center of gravity location that would give the aircraft approximately 10% longitudinal stability</li>
                <li>Obtain all of the stability coefficients (longitudinal, directional, and lateral)</li>
                <li>Create an Excel Spreadsheet to iterate the center of gravity location to get 10% longitudinal stability and validate all hand calculations</li>
                <li>Report all methods and findings in a final report</li>
            </ul>
